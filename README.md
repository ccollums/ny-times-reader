## Wins And Challenges 

### Wins
- A requirement for this project was that we self-teach and use a technology we had not used before. We decided to implement TypeScript. One key win was our ability to learn TypeScript in a very short period of time and use it within a complex web application.
- We also used React' Context API and this made for a fairly streamlined data model.
- It was a great experience using React's MUI library for beautiful, standardized components.
- Being able to give the user the ability to upload photos with Cloudinary API was another win that made this project successful.

### Challenges 
- As stated above, we challenged ourselves to implement TypeScript. This came with a healthy dose of challenges. Certain processes and features took longer than originally planned. Because we were learning as we went, we feel we would have planned differently from the beginning in terms of data flow and structure had we been more familiar with the intricacies of typed JavaScript.
